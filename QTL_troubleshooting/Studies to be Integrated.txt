Description for Data Sources:
  F1 generation created through breeding of wild-caught Pachon with Surface. F2 generation (n = 539) created through paired breeding of F1 Pachon-Surface siblings.
	Eye size was measured in 535 individuals on the left eye after removal of covering tissue. Relative eye size was obtained from regression of eye size on standard 
  length as the ratio of observed divided by the expected diameter. Lens width was measured in 115 individuals in the transverse section at its maximum diameter and 
  standardized against either standard length or eye size. Dentary bones measured in 218 fish, maxillary bones in 219. Bone lengths standardized to other major head 
  measurements and to opercular heights and lengths. Taste buds counted in 117 fish on the left side on the upper lip and dorsal to the nostril and the eye.
	The body regions in which melanophores were counted were defined as follows: 
	Above and forward of eye (n = 174) - Area centered at 3 mm above and forward of the left eye.
	Below dorsal fin (n = 174) - 3 mm under the middle of the dorsal fin.
	Anal fin (n = 128) - Left flank 3 mm above the middle of the anal fin.
	Lateral flank (n = 128) - Less pigmented area midway between the lateral line stripe and the more pigmented regions dorsal to it and under the center of the dorsal
  fin.
	QTL intervals determined using MultiQTL software with P < 0.05 and a false detection rate < 0.10. QTL detected in two phases: first by simple interval mapping (SIM)
  of putative QTL, followed by a refinement phase using multiple interval mapping algorithms (MIM). 
	QTL data comes from Table 2 of this publication and from the Supplementary Data 1 of Warren et al. 2021.
	Microsatellite linkage map with 29 linkage groups was generated using MultiPoint (threshold recombination of r < 0.20) on F2 fish DNA. Consistency of markers was 
  checked via jacknife analysis and inconsistently mapped markers were excluded from QTL analysis. This publication precedes creation of the first Mexican tetra 
  reference genome but all data was remapped to Warren et al. 2021.

Description for Data Sources:
	F2 Pachon-Surface (n = 539) cross described in Protas et al. 2007
	Measurement protocols and sample sizes for each quantitative trait:
	Relative Condition (n = 534) - Ratio of observed weight to weight predicted from regression of log weight on log length in well-fed fish.
	Peduncle Depth (n = 200) - Depth of caudal peduncle divided by standard length.
	Fin Placement (n = 200) - Distance from mouth to dorsal fin insertion divided by standard length.
	Chemical Sense (n = 113) - Threshold sensitivity to amino acids (L-alanine, L-serine, L-methionine, and L-proline with concentrations ranging from 10−6 to 10−11 
  molar, in 10-fold dilutions, and a pure water control) dissolved in individual's tank. Three tests of each individual were performed for each concentration, with 
  the orders randomized and the observer blinded. The data were used to calculate threshold sensitivity for each individual and were represented for analysis as 
  integers, representing orders of magnitude, ranging from 6 through 11. Pachón cave fish were tested in the same manner; surface fish were tested under reduced 
  illumination. 
	Length (n = 533) and Weight Loss ( Percent decrease in weight per day; n = 361) were measured periodically and at sacrifice.
	Anal Fin Rays (n = 214), Width of Sub-Orbital Bones (n = 221), and Thoracic Rib Count (n = 163) phenotyped using alizarin red staining.
	Maxillary Tooth Count (n = 227), Eye Size (n = 539), and Melanophore Count (Above and forward of eye) (n = 174) measured according to methods in Protas et al. 2007
	QTL intervals determined using MultiQTL software with P < 0.10. Single-trait QTL detected in two phases: first by simple interval mapping (SIM) of putative QTL, 
  followed by a refinement phase using multiple interval mapping algorithms (MIM). Multiple-trait (>= 3 traits) QTL detected using MultiQTL's multiple-trait maximum 
  likelihood algorithms.
	Table 1 was used as a key to determine the names of traits in Table 2 and 3. QTL for correlations between single traits and markers were obtained from Table 2 
  while QTL for correlations between __multiple__ traits and putatatively pleiotropic markers were obtained from Table 3. Remapped positional data came from the 
  Supplementary Data 1 of Warren et al. 2021.
	Linkage map obtained from Protas et al. 2007, with some additional microsatellite markers and 12 newly mapped genes. This publication precedes creation of the first
  Mexican tetra reference genome but all data was remapped to Warren et al. 2021.

Description for Data Sources:
	F1 generation (n ~= 130) created through paired breeding of 1 Pachon with 1 Surface from Jeffery lab-reared populations (descended several generations from 
  wild-caught; surface strain originated from Balmorhea Springs State Park, Texas). F2 generation (n = 384) created through paired breeding of F1 Pachon-Surface 
  siblings. F3 generation (n = 91) created from 3 pairs of F2 siblings (each of the F2 parents had at least 1 cavefish allele at markers identifed in a previous QTL 
  scan of the F2 generation to be associated with Vibration Attraction Behavior and Superficial Neuromasts in Eye Orbit)
	At 1-2 years of age, F2 and F3 hybrids were phenotyped 1-3x for Vibration Attraction Behavior (n = 227), 1x for number of Superficial Neuromasts in Eye Orbit 
  (n = 253), and 1x for Eye Size (n = 350). Vibration Attraction Behavior was measured by using ImageJ to count the number of approaches an acclimated fish made to a
  vibrating glass rod under infrared illumination. Eye diameter was measured digitally in ImageJ and standardized to standard length of fish. Albinism was measured 
  as a binary trait (n = 254).
	Two types of QTL strategies were performed in this study: (1) multiple interval mapping via the function *stepwiseqtl* in R/qtl and (2) single-QTL model mapping 
  accounting for relatedness in the program QTLRel. All logarithms of the odds (LOD) significant thresholds were determined following 2,000 permutation tests after 
  single-QTL model mapping with *scanone* implemented in R/qtl or *scanOne* in QTLRel. 
	QTL data comes from Table 2 of this publication.
	Microsatellite linkage map with 27 linkage groups, 246 SNP and microsatellite markers was generated using DNA from F2 individuals. This publication precedes

Borowsky, R., & Wilkens, H. (2002). Mapping a cave fish genome: polygenic systems and regressive evolution. *The Journal of heredity*, *93*(1), 19–21. 
Description for Data Sources:
	An F1 hybrid Pachon-Surface (unspecified strain) female was mated to a Pachon male to produce a backcross progeny (BC, n = 111). BC animals were raised in the 
  light in community tanks to the age of 6–8 months. 
	Residual of eye size, regressed to standard length of fish, used for all measurements of eye size. All fish were given binary score of albino or non-albino. 
  In nonalbino fish, melanophores were counted on standardized areas in three locations on the back, near the dorsal fin. The measure of condition factor (CF) 
  was the residual of the logarithm of weight after regression of log weight on log length. 
	Significance levels of QTL were determined by permuting the data as implemented by the Permutation Test module with significance threshold of p <= 0.05
	Linkage group-trait mappings were obtained from Table 1. 
	Partial linkage map generated using random amplified polymorphic DNA. This publication precedes creation of the first Mexican tetra reference genome.
